# ChatGPT-Website-Bypasser
Small side project used to bypass the website of GPT-3 by openAI to be able to use it even when the site is down
## How does it work?
It fetches the text from the input, generates the response by using the API and prints it out.
## Setup
1. Run `pip install openai` to install the library 
2. Modify main.py in line 22 by using your own API key [ (available on openAIs site) ](#how-to-create-an-api-key)
3. Run main.py
## Improvements
If you have any ideas for improvements or other stuff, feel free to create a pull request.
Remember, this is nothing big, just a very small side project that I quickly coded to use ChatGPT whenever I need it.
### Please notice:
This project is NOT using the up-to-date version of ChatGPT we can find on the website, as the API wasn't released for it yet (this is soon to come). Instead it uses the API of an 'older version' of ChatGPT.

### How to create an API key:
Head over to [the API key management](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), login/sign up, create a new API key and paste it into the file. (Never share your API key with anyone!)
