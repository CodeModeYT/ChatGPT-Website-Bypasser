# ChatGPT-Website-Bypasser
Small side project used to bypass the website of GPT-3 by openAI to be able to use it even when the site is down
## How does it work?
It fetches the text from the input, generates the response by using the API and prints it out.
## Setup
1. pip install openai
2. Modify main.py in line 22 by using your own API key (available on openAIs site)
3. Use it
## Improvements
If you have any ideas for improvements or other stuff, feel free to create a pull request.
Remember, this is nothing big, just a very small side project that I quickly coded to use ChatGPT whenever I need it.
